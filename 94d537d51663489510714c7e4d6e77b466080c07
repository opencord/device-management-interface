Is there someone from the project who could assist me in working on this? I believe it should be broken down into several smaller commits, but I need guidance on what the goals are here. There haven\u0027t been any commits to this repo in almost a year, but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s because it\u0027s inactive, or possibly because it\u0027s all blocked on this.",
