      "message": "Hi Amit,\n\nThis relates to something I mentioned during the last two TST meetings.\n\nThere is an ongoing effort to reduce monthly budgetary costs for all projects.\nDuring recent AWS cleanup someone inadvertently deleted a few AMI images\nthinking they were unused.  Unfortunately these images are a core dependency\nfor all Broadband/VOLTHA jobs.  All jenkins jobs are currently failing due\nto a lack of system/jenkins node to run them on.\n\nGiven our images contain some older interpreter and library versions\nI am working on gathering system details and will be reconstructing\nthe instances from scratch and a clean ubuntu installation.",
